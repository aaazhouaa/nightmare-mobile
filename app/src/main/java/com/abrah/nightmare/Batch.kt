 *
 * ⭐ **A run MODE, not a graph change** (`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §8b). The graph
 * on the canvas is untouched — overrides go onto a copy per iteration, exactly
 * as `HarnessOps.runRolled` already copies for the rolled seed. That is what
 * makes the executor's cache do the heavy lifting for free: a 4-seed sweep
 * re-runs the sampler and everything after it, and reuses the photo, the crop,
 * the mask and the conditioning, because their keys never move.
