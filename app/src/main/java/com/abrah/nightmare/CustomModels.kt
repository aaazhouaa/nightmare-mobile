/**
 * ⭐ Checkpoints the USER brought — imported from a zip, or copied into the
 * models directory by hand.
 *
 * ⚠⚠ **A custom model is a full [ModelSpec], not a special case.** It is merged
 * into [ModelCatalog.all], so `byId`, `backendTypeOf`, `resolutionOf`,
 * `SelectedModel.set` and the executor's context key all resolve it exactly
 * like a built-in. That is not tidiness: `backendTypeOf` **falls back to
 * `sd15npu` for an id it does not know**, so a custom SDXL model the catalogue
 * could not see would launch the backend `--type sd15npu` and render at 512 in
 * silence. Being invisible to `byId` is the failure mode, not being absent from
 * a list.
 *
 * ## ⚠ Why this does not follow either upstream
 *
 * Both reference apps declare a model's family with a **marker file** —
 * `npucustom` / `SDXL` / `ANIMA` / `finished` upstream, only `npucustom` in
 * DreamUI. A marker is a claim that can be wrong, and upstream's own zip
 * importer proves it: `ModelListScreen.kt` writes `npucustom` at the end of
 * **every** import including an SDXL one, so an SDXL zip imported through its
 * UI is mislabelled SD 1.5 by the tool that unpacked it.
 *
 * ⇒ **We infer the family from the files instead**, which cannot disagree with
 * what is on disk. The discriminator is the CLIP side and it is unambiguous:
 * SD 1.5 ships one `clip_v2.mnn`, SDXL ships `clip_2.mnn` (CLIP-G) beside
 * `clip.mnn`. No archive contains both.
 *
 * ⚠ The interesting property is that a *partial* directory can never be
 * MISCLASSIFIED, only unclassifiable — the discriminators are disjoint, so a
 * half-extracted SDXL model is never mistaken for an SD 1.5 one. It is listed
 * as partial with [ModelSpec.missing] naming what is absent, exactly like a
 * half-downloaded built-in.
 *
 * ⇒ **No marker file, and therefore no marker-written-last dance.** A model
 * directory pushed over adb (`notes/HANDOFF.md` §5) is picked up with no extra
 * step, which the marker designs cannot do.
 *
 * ⚠ What IS taken from upstream — and what DreamUI dropped — is
 * [Config]: an optional `config.json` inside the model directory carrying the
 * checkpoint's own label and prompts. DreamUI replaced it with one hardcoded
 * neutral prompt for every import.

     * DreamUI dropped in favour of one hardcoded prompt for every import. A
     * checkpoint's prompt style is the thing its author knows and we cannot
     * guess — an anime model and a photographic one want opposite negatives —

     * are inferred from the files (see the class note) and an override would be
     * a way to make the catalogue disagree with the disk — which is the exact
     * failure this design exists to prevent.
     *
     * ⚠ Null means "not specified"; every field falls back. A malformed file is
     * a warning and an empty config, never a failed import: the model's files
     * are fine and a bad `config.json` should not cost the user the download.
