 * (SM8635) is newer than an 8 Gen 2 and fails everything, because the "s" tier
 * reuses the flagship name with a cut-down HTP. A QNN context binary declares
 * every feature it needs and the device rejects the **first** one it lacks —
 * arch, then VTCM, then fp16 — one at a time, so fixing one reveals the next.
 * All of this is measured, not extrapolated: `../LocalDream/docs/DEVICE-SUPPORT.md`.
 *
 * ⇒ Two numbers decide everything here: the HTP **arch** and its **VTCM** in MB.
 * [measure] gets both from the hardware; [caps] falls back to a table only until
 * it has.
