/**
 * ⭐⭐ A model download, in the notification shade.
 *
 * ⚠⚠ **Because a 3.7 GB download outlives the screen.** The Models tab draws a
 * progress bar, and that bar is only on screen while the tab is. A user starts a
 * checkpoint, locks the phone, and has no way to tell whether it is still going,
 * finished, or died — which is the state this app has had since the downloader
 * was written. Asked for 2026-09-15.
 *
 * ⚠ Not a foreground service. The download already runs in the ViewModel's
 * scope, and promoting it would be a bigger change than the problem: this is a
 * READOUT, and if the process dies the notification goes with it, which is
 * honest — the download died too.
 *
 * ⚠⚠ Android 13+ needs POST_NOTIFICATIONS. Ungranted, `notify` is a silent
 * no-op — so nothing here may be load-bearing, and nothing is: the tab's own
 * bar is still the source of truth.
