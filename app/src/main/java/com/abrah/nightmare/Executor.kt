 * The executor: a topologically ordered walk of a [Graph] that runs only the

 *
 * ⭐ This is the difference between a node graph and a preset picker with wires
 * (docs/ARCHITECTURE.md §4). `/sample` was already content-addressed and `/handles`
 * already reported what was resident; nothing consulted either, so re-running
 * an unchanged node re-rendered it.
 *
 * ⚠⚠ The cache is TWO facts, not one, and both are required:
 *
 *  1. the app's `key -> value` memory, which survives as long as this object;
 *  2. `GET /handles`, which says whether the backend still holds the tensor
 *     that value names.
 *
 * Trusting (1) alone serves a handle the backend no longer has -- after a
 * restart, an idle release, or an eviction -- and `/vae_decode` answers that
 * with an error rather than with a wrong picture, so the failure is at least
 * loud. Trusting (2) alone cannot work at all: the executor never computes a
 * backend handle id, it only remembers one. ⇒ [prune] is what joins them, and
 * `graph` pass D on the device is the check that it is really consulted -- a
 * pure in-app cache passes every other pass identically.
