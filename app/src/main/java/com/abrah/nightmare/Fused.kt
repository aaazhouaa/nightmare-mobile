/**
 * ⭐⭐⭐ **The SD sampler — four types, one implementation.**
 *
 * `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §5.7. It absorbs `sd.vae_encode`, `sd.vae_decode`,
 * `sd.latent_blend`, `image.mask`, `image.mask_crop` and `image.paste`, none of
 * which passed the test that earns a node.
 *
 * ⚠⚠ **It forks on CAPABILITY and on FAMILY** — the user's call, 2026-09-15,
 * against a recommendation to fork on capability alone:
 *
 * | | text/image | inpaint |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | **SD 1.5** | `sd15.sample` | `sd15.inpaint` |
 * | **SDXL** | `sdxl.sample` | `sdxl.inpaint` |
 *
 * ⭐ The capability fork is what was actually asked for and it is plainly right:
 * an image-to-image flow was being handed a mask editor it has no use for, and
 * a node's ports cannot depend on a checkpoint. ⇒ The `sample` types have no
 * mask port, no painting params and no mask editor **at all**, so the surface a
 * user meets is the surface they need.
 *
 * ⚠⚠ The family fork was the user's choice over the alternative of one pair
 * with a model dropdown. What it buys is a palette that states the family and a
 * node that cannot be pointed at a checkpoint of the wrong kind. What it costs
 * is written down here so it is not rediscovered: **a graph chaining SD 1.5 into
 * SDXL needs two different node types for the same job**, and every rule keyed
 * on a sampler's type name must ask a SET (`SAMPLER_TYPES`, `BatchParams`,
 * `FRAMES`/`PAINTS`, `hiddenKnob`) rather than compare one string.
 *
 * ⇒ **One class, four registrations.** Four copies of this logic would be four
 * places for the blend argument order to drift, and that mistake is invisible
 * (`FusedSamplerTest`). The differences are exactly two constructor arguments.
 *
 * ⚠ **Latent-blend vs a 9-channel inpaint model is NOT a fifth type — and not a
 * chip either.** Same ports, same editor; the MODEL the node names is the whole
 * choice. An inpaint render always sends its picture and mask with `sample`, and
 * the backend uses them only when its UNet takes 9 channels
 * (`backend-patches/006`). The user's call, 2026-09-19, replacing the chip this
 * note used to promise: a knob that only restates the model is not a knob.
 *
 * ⚠⚠ **It does not draw its own picture.** The user's call, 2026-09-15: a
 * render appears on `core.output` and nowhere else, so a graph says where its
 * result goes. The executor refuses a run whose render has nowhere to land.
