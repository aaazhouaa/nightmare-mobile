/**
 * Everything a plugin can ask the host to do — the whole of it.
 *
 * ⭐⭐ This class IS the sandbox boundary (docs/ARCHITECTURE.md §7). QuickJS
 * gives a script exactly one native global, `host.call`, and it lands here, so
 * the set of things a downloaded plugin can do to the device is the `when`
 * below. That is what makes the manifest's `permissions` list checkable instead
 * of decorative — and it is why a new capability must be added *here*, as a
 * named op, rather than by handing JS another object.
 *
 * ⚠ Ops are `group.verb` and take/return JSON objects. Images are named by
 * handle, never carried: see [ImageStore].
 */
/**
 * The backend ops a plugin may reach, as a SYNCHRONOUS interface.
 *
 * ⚠⚠ Synchronous is not a preference, it is what QuickJS gives us: `host.call`
 * returns a string, and there is no event loop behind it to await a promise on.
 * So a backend-touching host op **blocks the node's thread for the whole HTTP
 * round trip** — a `latent.blend` is ~50 ms, but a future op that sampled would
 * block for seconds.
 *
 * That is sound only because the executor runs nodes sequentially and off the
 * main thread (docs/ARCHITECTURE.md §4). ⇒ Two things follow, and they are
 * written here because the day they matter it will not be obvious: a
 * long-running op must stay cancellable through the same route the sampler uses
 * (hanging up the stream), and nodes running concurrently would need this
 * interface to become genuinely async, which means promises in the prelude.
