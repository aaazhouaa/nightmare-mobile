/**
 * The app-side half of "handles, not buffers" (docs/ARCHITECTURE.md §6).
 *
 * ⭐ A plugin node never receives pixels. It receives an id, passes it to a host
 * op, and gets another id back — so a 512² image crosses the JS boundary as ~40
 * bytes of JSON rather than 780 KB of array, and the sandbox costs nothing.
 * Latents and conditionings live in the backend's own table; images live here,
 * because image ops are app-side and never touch the backend (§3).
 *
 * ⚠⚠ Ids are CONTENT ADDRESSES — a SHA of the actual pixels, not a counter.
 * That is what makes the executor's cache work across recomputation: two runs
 * that produce the same image produce the same id, so everything downstream of
 * them stays cached. A counter would make every re-run look like new data and
 * quietly turn the cache off.
