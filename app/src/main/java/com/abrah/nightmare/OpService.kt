/**
 * ⭐ Runs a harness op with NOTHING ON SCREEN.
 *
 * ```
 * adb shell am start-foreground-service -n com.abrah.nightmare/.OpService --es op graph
 * adb logcat -s Harness:I Harness:W
 * ```
 *
 * ⚠ start-FOREGROUND-service, and the "foreground" is about process priority,
 * NOT about the screen: it posts a notification and takes no focus, no window
 * and no attention. A plain `am startservice` is refused outright with
 * "Error: app is in background uid null" (measured 2026-09-08) -- Android 12+
 * forbids background service starts, and the harness is only ever started while
 * the app IS in the background, which is the entire point of it.
 *
 * ⚠⚠ Why this exists. `am start … --es op …` works, but it FOREGROUNDS the app
 * over whatever the person holding the phone was doing -- and this is somebody's
 * actual phone, not a lab device. A 30 s executor check is not worth taking
 * their screen, and "ask first, then take the screen anyway" does not scale to a
 * loop that runs all day. This path costs them nothing: no window, no focus
 * change, no interruption.
 *
 * ⚠ The ops are [HarnessOps], shared verbatim with the buttons. A service with
 * its own copy would drift, and two front ends that disagree make a device
 * report unattributable.
 *
 * ⚠ The output goes to LOGCAT only, so `adb logcat -s Harness:I` is the whole
 * result. There is no in-app log to read afterwards -- the view model's list
 * belongs to the activity, which may not even be running.
