/**
 * Installs a plugin from a zip — the shape a *downloaded* plugin arrives in.
 *
 * ⚠⚠ This is the first code in the project that unpacks an archive somebody
 * else made, and unpacking is where archive handling goes wrong. Three limits
 * below are not defensive programming, they are the actual attack surface:
 *
 *  1. **Zip slip.** An entry named `../../../databases/x` walks out of the
 *     destination and overwrites app files. The check is on the RESOLVED
 *     canonical path, not on the name, because `a/../../b` looks harmless.
 *  2. **Zip bombs.** A few KB can expand to gigabytes. Entry count and total
 *     written bytes are both capped, and the cap is checked WHILE writing —
 *     an entry's declared size is attacker-controlled and can simply lie.
 *  3. **Absolute and rooted names**, which some zip writers emit and which
 *     resolve outside the destination on their own.
 *
 * ⚠ The manifest is parsed BEFORE anything lands in the plugins directory: a
 * zip is unpacked to a staging directory, validated, and only then moved into
 * place under the id its manifest declares. So a malformed pack never becomes a
 * half-installed plugin that the loader trips over later.
 *
 * ⚠ This does not download anything, and that is deliberate: where a plugin may
 * COME from is an open policy question (`notes/HANDOFF.md` §7, `ARCHITECTURE`
 * §7), and building a downloader would answer it by accident.
