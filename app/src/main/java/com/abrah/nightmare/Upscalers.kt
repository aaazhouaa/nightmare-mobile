/**
 * ⭐⭐ **Upscalers: the second KIND of model this app installs.**
 *
 * ⚠⚠ A separate catalogue from [ModelCatalog] rather than more rows in it, and
 * the reason is not tidiness — the two differ in every way that matters:
 *
 * | | checkpoint | upscaler |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | on disk | a directory of ~12 files, unzipped | ONE loose `upscaler.bin` |
 * | download | a 1-3.7 GB zip, extracted | a 8-24 MB file, used as-is |
 * | launch | binds `--type`/`--model_dir`/`--patch` | **nothing** |
 * | context key | `(type, model, resolution)` | **none** |
 * | loading | held for the process's life | per REQUEST, freed after |
 *
 * ⭐⭐⭐ **The last two rows are why an upscaler can share a graph with a
 * sampler.** `/upscale` is registered in `main.cpp` outside the `if (pipeline)`
 * guards and builds its QNN model from the path in the request header, so it
 * runs inside whichever backend is already up and costs no process transition
 * (`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §4). An upscaler is not a checkpoint the graph is
 * pinned to; it is a file a node names. ⚠ `--upscaler_mode` is unrelated — it
 * means "a server with NO diffusion model".
 *
 * ⚠ Sizes below were read from the Hugging Face tree API on 2026-09-10, not
 * estimated: they are what the free-space check and the progress bar divide by.
