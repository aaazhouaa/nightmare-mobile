 * both the sampler and the output node in `previews` under one image id. A
 * `firstOrNull` over that map answers whichever the map happened to hold first
 * — usually the sampler, which [clipNodes] correctly rejects as not owning the
 * clip — and the caller then falls back to the still.
 *
 * ⚠⚠ That exact bug has been written **twice**: once in Save and Share
 * (2026-09-13, the poster saved instead of the clip) and again in the keep path
 * (2026-09-15, every auto-kept video result filed as a still while the node
 * viewer kept playing). Both times by hand-rolling the join instead of calling
 * it. ⇒ It lives here now, and both call it. Two surfaces that must agree call
 * the SAME function (`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §5.6).
