/**
 * ⭐⭐⭐ **Point one sampler at another checkpoint, and say what else moves.**

 * DEFAULT. A checkbox's unticked state is "no", so the safe default was "take
 * nothing" — which made the recommended answer the one that needed two extra
 * taps, and left the dialog saying nothing about which answer is usually right.
 * A radio pair states both answers and can recommend one. The user's call,
 * 2026-09-15: *"the options can be radio: Use model prompts (recommended)
 * (default) and use same prompt. and one more radio set for other params"*.
 *
 * ⚠⚠⚠ **Recommended means DEFAULT here, or the word is decoration.** Both
 * groups therefore default to the checkpoint's own values, which is also what
 * the top-bar picker already does (`modelRecipeRetarget`, `modelPromptRetarget`)
 * — asking for a checkpoint is asking for its published recipe. ⚠ This reverses
 * the "off by default" note of earlier the same day, and it is safe to reverse
 * precisely because the dialog now SHOWS the text it would write: the argument
 * for defaulting to "keep mine" was that a silent overwrite of a typed sentence
 * is the worst trade in the app, and nothing here is silent.
 *
 * ⚠ A family change is stated as a fact rather than a warning — every wire
 * survives it, because the two sampler types declare the same ports
 * (`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §5.7). What DOES change is the render size, and that
 * is the half worth saying.
