/**
 * ⭐⭐ Arm a knob for a sweep — **with sliders, never a text box.**

 * ⚠⚠⚠ The first version asked people to type `1..20 by 2`. That is a grammar to
 * learn, on a phone keyboard, where a typo is silent until the count reads zero
 * — and the person typing it has a slider for every other number in this app.
 * Reported bluntly from the phone, 2026-09-10.
 *
 * ⇒ Three shapes, one per kind of knob:
 *  - a **range** (`steps`, `cfg`, `denoise`): from, to, and a step that can only
 *    grow, in multiples of the knob's own increment
 *  - a **set** (`scheduler`): multi-select over its declared options
 *  - a **count** (`seed`): how many, because a seed is an identifier rather than
 *    a magnitude and "seeds 1000..1009" is nobody's intent
 *
 * ⚠⚠ **The step only gets COARSER.** `cfg` moves in 0.1; allowing finer makes
 * 1..20 into 1900 renders, and the cap would then refuse after the work of
 * setting it up rather than before. ⚠ And `to` is SNAPPED to the last value the
 * step actually reaches — otherwise the slider shows a bound the sweep never
 * produces, which is a control lying about its own state.
