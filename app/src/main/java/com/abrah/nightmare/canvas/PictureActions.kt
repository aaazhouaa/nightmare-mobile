/**
 * ⭐⭐⭐ The actions on ONE rendered picture — bin · keep · download · share ·
 * star — and the only thing that draws them, on the canvas and in Results.
 *
 * ⚠⚠⚠ **The disk and the star swapped jobs, 2026-09-15.** Reported from the
 * phone: *"the save icon is confusing. what it currently does is a download."*
 * It was exactly that — a floppy that wrote a PNG to the gallery, while the
 * star did the keeping. Two glyphs, both meaning "save", neither meaning what
 * it looked like.
 *
 * | | before | now |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | 💾 [onKeep] | wrote to the gallery | **keeps in Results** |
 * | ⬇ [onDownload] | — | **writes to the gallery** |
 * | ⭐ [onStar] | kept in Results | **keeps in Results AND flags it Favourite** |
 *
 * ⚠ Two buttons that both keep is deliberate, not an oversight: the star is the
 * one-tap way to keep something you already know you want back, and Results
 * filters on the flag it sets. Starring a picture that is already kept just
 * toggles the flag.
 *
 * ⚠ Each action is nullable so a surface offers only what applies; the ORDER of
 * whatever is offered never changes — destructive first, then keep, download,
 * share, star. The caller puts the seed or a primary action AFTER this.
