 * another reason.

 * ⚠ `frame` feeds THREE consumers and they must all want the same size — they
 * do, because `vae_encode` and `latent_blend` both demand the render size and
 * `mask` passes that demand through. That is the whole reason the mask node is
 * `sizedByConsumer`.
 *
 * ⚠ ONE `encode`, not two: `base` and the sampler's starting latent are the
 * same picture, and encoding it twice would cost a second VAE pass for an
 * identical tensor the cache would have to notice anyway.
 *
 * ⚠ `denoise` at 0.85 rather than img2img's 0.6 — inside the mask the point is
 * to make something new, and the untouched surroundings come from `base`
 * regardless. A low denoise here reads as "the mask did nothing".
