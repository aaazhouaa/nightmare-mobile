 * would put that scheduler's state in JS. The decomposition that earns its
 * keep here is the one at the EDGES — the clip comes out as a value another
 * node consumes.
 *
 * ⭐⭐ **`image` is optional, and that is deliberate from the first version.**
 * Connected it means image-to-video; unconnected it means generate the first
 * frame too. The user's call, 2026-09-12: *"of course we will add i2v later so
 * sample might need to allow encoded image latent"* — so the port exists now,
 * before any saved workflow references this node, because
 * `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §7 says a node's shape cannot be extended once
 * workflows depend on it.
 *
 * ⚠ It is an **IMAGE**, not a LATENT, and the difference is honest rather than
 * a simplification: `Video.generate` takes a bitmap and does its own VAE encode
 * (`vaeenc`), because the reference pipeline's native entry point is
 * `generate(image=…)`. There is no separate video `vae_encode` op to wire a
 * LATENT out of, so a LATENT port would name a value nothing in this app can
 * produce. ⇒ When the encoder becomes its own node, that is when the port type
 * changes — with a version bump, not by widening this one.

     * to play clips: *"for video output node, save should be always true"*
     * (2026-09-12).
     *
     * ⚠⚠ The original reason was that nothing could play a clip, so a run
     * that left the MP4 in `cacheDir` produced something the user could not
     * watch. That reason is **gone** — fullscreen plays it now
     * ([com.abrah.nightmare.ui.ClipPlayer]) — and the default stays anyway,
     * because the file underneath it does not: a clip lives in `cacheDir`,
     * which Android clears without asking, where a picture the user is looking
     * at can be saved from the viewer afterwards.
     *
     * ⚠⚠ It is a **CHECKBOX**, not a text field. It rendered as one — typing
     * the word `true` on a phone keyboard, where `True` reads as false and
     * nothing says so until a Run that quietly wrote nothing — because the
     * inspector had no `bool` branch at all (`canvas/NodeInspector.kt`).
     *
     * ⚠ The switch stays and turning it off is still right while iterating on
     * a prompt; it is the DEFAULT that is true, not the value.
