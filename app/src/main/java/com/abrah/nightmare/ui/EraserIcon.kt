/**
 * An eraser — **the same glyph DreamUI draws**, deliberately.
 *
 * ⚠⚠ Ported rather than re-invented. The mask editor here and the one in
 * DreamUI are the same tool doing the same job, and a user who has both
 * installed should not have to learn two icons for "erase". Asked for from the
 * phone, 2026-09-10: use DreamUI's brush properties and its icons.
 *
 * ⚠ It is hand-built because the icon set genuinely does not ship one:
 * `material-icons-extended` is generated from the classic Material Icons set,
 * which has no eraser — `ink_eraser` is a Material *Symbols* glyph and
 * postdates it. The near misses all say something else next to a paint brush:
 * `AutoFixNormal` is a wand, `Deselect` is about selection, `CleaningServices`
 * is a spray bottle. Any of them reads as a second effect rather than as the
 * brush's opposite.
 *
 * Geometry: a 14.1 x 7.07 rectangle rotated 45°, cut across at 40% of its
 * length to separate rubber from sleeve, resting on a baseline bar. ⚠ The cut
 * is a **gap**, not a drawn line — a one-colour vector cannot draw a divider
 * inside its own fill.
