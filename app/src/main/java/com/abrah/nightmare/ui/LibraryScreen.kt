 * ⚠ They were separate full screens reached from separate buttons, so moving

 * recipes want one". They are the same question asked twice, and the answer to
 * one is usually why you are asking the other.
 *
 * ⚠ The top row switches by TAP, not by swipe, and that is deliberate: the
 * swipe axis belongs to the family sub-tabs inside Models. Two nested pagers on
 * one axis is a gesture a user has to think about, and the inner one is the one
 * that earns it — a 15-row list whose two halves differ in size by 3.5×.

/**
 * ⭐ A **pill** row over a swipeable pager, for a list that splits by family.
 *
 * ⚠⚠ **Pills, not a second `TabRow`, and that is the whole point of this
 * change.** This sits directly under [LibraryScreen]'s own tab row, and two
 * underlined tab rows stacked five dp apart read as one confused control:
 * nothing says which of "Models / Flows" and "SD 1.5 / SDXL" is the parent, and
 * the two underlines compete. Reported from the phone 2026-09-10.
 *
 * ⇒ The OUTER level keeps the underlined tabs — it is the primary navigation —
 * and this inner one becomes a segmented pill group, which is Material's own
 * idiom for filtering the content of a page rather than changing pages.
 *
 * ⚠⚠ The PAGER is the source of truth and the row follows it. Driving both from
 * one externally-held index makes a half-finished swipe leave the row and the
 * page disagreeing, and the row then highlights a tab the user is not looking
 * at.
 *
 * ⚠ A tap animates rather than jumps, so a tap and a swipe land the user in the
 * same place by the same motion — otherwise the two read as different features.
