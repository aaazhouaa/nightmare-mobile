/**
 * ⭐⭐ The top of every screen that sits OVER the canvas — Models, Flows and the
 * op harness.
 *
 * ⚠⚠ One composable rather than three headers, because three had already
 * drifted into three different answers to the same question: Models said
 * "Back", Flows said "Back to canvas" beside a second button, and the harness
 * drew an arrow icon. Same gesture, same destination, three shapes and two
 * type sizes — a user learns the corner, not the wording, and the corner was
 * the only thing they agreed on.
 *
 * ⭐ **A close icon, not a back arrow.** None of these is a step in a journey;
 * each is a panel over the canvas, and the canvas is always what is behind it.
 * An arrow promises history that does not exist — there is nowhere else to go
 * back to — where an ✕ says "put this away", which is what the tap does.
 *
 * ⚠ The icon stays in the SAME CORNER the canvas puts the control that opened
 * the screen, so the trip out and the trip back are one thumb position.
