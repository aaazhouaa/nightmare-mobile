/**
 * ⚠⚠ The gesture MODIFIER, driven by real touch events.
 *
 * `CanvasStateTest` calls `press`/`drag`/`release` directly, so it proves the
 * state machine and nothing about whether a finger ever reaches it. That gap is
 * how a canvas that "responds to touch" in the runbook could ship unable to move
 * a node: every JVM test passed, every golden passed, and the only thing never
 * exercised was the wiring between a pointer event and the state machine.
 *
 * ⚠ These tests must fail if the modifier is rewired wrongly, so they assert on
 * the STATE the modifier produced, not on pixels.
