# backend otherwise, and an old backend that answers /health looks exactly like

# It was V79 only, which meant the APK ran on exactly one phone. `libQnnHtp.so`
# dispatches on the arch of the DEVICE, not of the context binary, so an 8 Gen 2
# needs a V73 Skel present to initialise the NPU AT ALL -- even though every
# model we ship is a context it could otherwise load. A missing Skel is not a
# slow path, it is `Failed to create context from binary` with nothing in the
# message pointing at the cause.
#
# ⚠ The APK carries all six; the APP unpacks only the one it needs at runtime
# (DeviceProbe.runtimeLibs), so the 150 MB is a download cost, not a per-start
# copy. Upstream local-dream and DreamUI both ship all six for this reason.
#
# ⚠ Keep this list in step with DeviceProbe.STAGED_ARCHES -- a staged arch with
# no entry there is dead weight, and an entry with no staged arch is a phone
# that fails NPU init.
